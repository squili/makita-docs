# Getting a bot token

1. Navigate to the [Discord developers page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click `New Application`
3. Pick a name and click `Create`
4. Click the `Bot` tab in the sidebar
5. Click `Add Bot` and then `Yes, do it!`
6. Look to the token section (under the username) and click the `Copy` button

Take a look at the url. You see that big number? Congrats, you've just found your bot's id.
You'll be using that info in the [managing](./managing.md) step.

You now have your token on your clipboard. If you ever lose it, you can get it back
by going back to the [Discord developers page](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
clicking your application, going to the `Bot` tab, and repeating step 6.
