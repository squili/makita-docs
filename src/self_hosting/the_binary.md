# Getting the binary

What you do here is entirely dependent on where you're deploying to.

## Local installation

1. Navigate your ass to <https://github.com/squili/makita/releases/latest>
2. Observe the assets section and its curated list of entries
3. Gaze upon the entry labelled `makita` and click it
4. Use your computer to move the file to some directory where it can have some privacy
5. Make sure it has the correct permissions with `chmod +x makita`
6. Isn't that crazy, you've just downloaded a binary from github

## Remote installation

1. Navigate your ass to <https://github.com/squili/makita/releases/latest>
2. Right-click on the asset labelled `makita`
3. Click copy link
4. Download the file onto your remote machine
   1. Use `wget <link>` or your preferred tool for downloading data from the internet
5. Make sure it has the correct permissions with `chmod +x makita`

Remember that Makita will keep itself up to date,
so you will only need to do this process once.
