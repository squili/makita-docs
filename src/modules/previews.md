# Previews

Previews allow you to display messages in a static, embed-based representation. You can
either run the `/previews view` command directly or add each channel you want to
automatically preview message links with `/previews add`.

## Archive

Once you set a channel as your archive channel with `/previews archive`, you can use the
`Archive` context menu item to send messages to the set channel immediately.
