# Modules

Note that the documentation will not include much information about individual commands.
This is because Discord slash commands are self-documenting. Just press the `/` key on your
keyboard (I hope I don't need to make a chapter on how to do that) and you'll see all the
fancy little commands with descriptions on what they do.
